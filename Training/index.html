          <h1>Training</h1>
          <p>
            Training, I had a bit of experience of road biking, before I started mountain biking, and I certainly was not fit enough at the beginning to take on these mountains, but I found with perseverance I could improve my fitness levels by choosing the route that had some climbing to it, and after six months of regularly cycling these routes, I found I was getting stronger and could manage the more difficult routes, the secret is not to go too far in the beginning, but slowly build up the distance you cycle, I am afraid the only rule to follow is being consistent.

            Making Friends
            one of the best ways of getting fit, finding people who are interested in the same type of sport that you are in, that's why I always recommend joining a club specialising in the sport you enjoy, it does not matter if you are a novice or experienced, you will find that you will easily slot into a group that fit your experience.

          <h1>Buenos Aires</h1>
          <p>
            my first stab at mountain biking, was going from Bacolod to Buenos Aires, which is roughly 35 km, the easiest way is by road, but the club I belong to Team Stingray, like to go off-road, which is much more exciting but also hard work at least for me, sometimes along the way we would find that bridges across the river's have collapsed, but invariably we would find a guy with a boat who could fit our bikes on the boat, and get us across, the people in the countryside here are so nice and helpful, Buenos Aires is a mountain resort with lovely scenery and waterfalls, and places where you can stop to eat, the guy's often go to a butcher shop on the way, and buy some meat, and when we get to Buenos Aires they will happily barbecue the meat for us, great experience for a novice like me.
